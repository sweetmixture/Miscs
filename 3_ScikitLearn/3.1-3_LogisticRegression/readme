include deprecated feature (multi_class arg in LogisticRegression()) fix

from sklearn.multiclass import OneVsRestClassifier
'''
    FutureWarning: 'multi_class' was deprecated in version 1.5 and will be removed in 1.7.
    Use OneVsRestClassifier(LogisticRegression(..)) instead. Leave it to its default value to avoid this warning.

    From then on, it will always use 'multinomial'. Leave it to its default value to avoid this warning.
